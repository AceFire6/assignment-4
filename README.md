----------

### Instructions:

1. Use `make run ARGS="<args>"` to run the program. <args> is what you'd
normally put after the binary. (eg. `-a i1 i2 out.pgm`)
2. Use `make run-tests` to run the pre-prepared tests that test the
functionality of the code.
3. Use `make clean` to delete all binary files.

### Files:

* Image.cpp: The main file of the Image class.
* Image.h: The header file of the Image class.
* main.cpp: The driver file. Argument parsing happens here.
* Unittests.cpp: This is where the catch unit tests are defined.
* catch.hpp: This runs the unit tests.
* build/ : This is where the built files go. Images for testing can
be found inside.
